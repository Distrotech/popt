{"name":"Popt","tagline":"","body":"This is the popt command line option parsing library. While it is similiar\r\nto getopt(3), it contains a number of enhancements, including:\r\n\r\n\t1) popt is fully reentrant\r\n\t2) popt can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays while \r\n\t   getopt(2) makes this quite difficult\r\n\t3) popt allows users to alias command line arguments\r\n\t4) popt provides convience functions for parsing strings\r\n\t   into argv[] style arrays\r\n\r\npopt is used by rpm, the Red Hat install program, and many other Red Hat\r\nutilities, all of which provide excellent examples of how to use popt. \r\nComplete documentation on popt is available in popt.ps (included in this\r\ntarball), which is excerpted with permission from the book \"Linux\r\nApplication Development\" by Michael K. Johnson and Erik Troan (availble\r\nfrom Addison Wesley in May, 1998).\r\n\r\nComments on popt should be addressed to ewt@redhat.com.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
